"Handles become a hacker’s identity when they’re online. What is Emmanuel Goldstein’s?"

Googling "Emmanuel Goldstein", we see a wikipedia article about the
chatacter in Orwell's 1984. In the "Others" section it mentions a 1995
film "Hackers" which contained a character with that name.

Going to the wikipedia entry of "Hackers" and ctrl-f'ing "Emmanuel", we get:
Emmanuel "Cereal Killer" Goldstein

Flag: Cereal Killer
