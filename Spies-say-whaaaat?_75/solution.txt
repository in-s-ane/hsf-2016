More specifically, the following passage:
In order to safeguard the identity of his spies, Tallmadge utilized a number of protective measures.
Tallmadge gave his informants pseudonyms and invented a numerical substitution system to identify
his informants rather than use names. Seven hundred and sixty-three numbers were used, with 711
denoting General Washington, 745 representing England, and 727 for New York. Tallmadge and his associates also wrote in invisible ink.

Thus, the flag is:
New York was swarming with redcoats so secrecy was tantamount

P.S: How is this trivia?
