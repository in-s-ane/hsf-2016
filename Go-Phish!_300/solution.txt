After extracting the zip archive, we can start analzing the memory dump.

$ volatility -f phishing.vemv imageinfo

We find that the profile we need to analyze is Win7SP0x86.
We can look at the running processes by running:

$ volatility -f phishing.vemv --profile Win7SP0x86 pslist

Since this unknown file was downloaded from a link, we should inspect the firefox process, with pid 2144

$ volatility -f phishing.vemv --profile Win7SP0x86 memdump -p 2144 --dump-dir .
$ strings 2144.dmp | grep http > firefox

Looking through the links, we find a dropbox one, which happened to be the flag:
