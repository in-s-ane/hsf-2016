Somehow you are supposed to know that you need to use steghide to extract data from the image, and that the password is "totesadorbz".

$ steghide extract -sf hedgehog.jpg -p totesadorbz
wrote extracted data to "totesadorbz.txt".
$ cat totesadorbz.txt
flag{H3dgeh0gsAreLikeS00perCute}

Remove the flag{}, and get H3dgeh0gsAreLikeS00perCute
