Looking through the traffic, we find some tcp packets which seem to indicate that the user went to pastebin.com. One of the urls is
http://pastebin.com/DQ8yiYcQ, which contains a list of .onion sites.

Using curl and tor, we can quickly check to see which sites are valid.
We can configure curl to use tor by adding the following line to ~/.curlrc:
proxy = socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050

Turns out the correct url is https://vrpexywsisp5izxx.onion

By curling the site, we see that the page seems to be loaded by javascript, from /js/script.js:
...
{title: 'all', category: ''},
{title: 'cats', category: 'cat'},
{title: 'mild dank', category: 'mild'},
{title: 'medium dank', category: 'medium'},
{title: 'pure dank', category: 'pure'},
{title: 'top5', category: 'top5'},
{title: 'harambe', category: 'gorilla'},
{title: 'l337hax', category: 'hax'},
{title: 'lorem ipsum', category: 'lorem'},
//{title: 'admin', category: '/admin.html'},
...

If we visit admin.html, we get the flag:
$ curl vrpexywsisp5izxx.onion/admin.html
